# High Availability Kubernetes Control Plane with HAProxy and Keepalived

This guide describes how to provision a highly available Kubernetes control plane using a virtual IP (VIP) managed by HAProxy and Keepalived. This setup ensures API server availability even if one or more control plane nodes fail.

## Architecture

- **Control Plane Nodes:** 192.168.1.9, 192.168.1.3, 192.168.1.8
- **VIP:** 192.168.1.100 (used as `controlPlaneEndpoint` in kubeadm config)
- **HAProxy:** Load balances traffic to all healthy control plane nodes
- **Keepalived:** Manages the VIP failover between control plane nodes

## Steps

1. **Install HAProxy and Keepalived** on all control plane nodes:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install haproxy keepalived -y
   ```

Backup the default config (in case you need it later):

sudo cp /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg.bak

sudo nano /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg

2. **Configure HAProxy** to forward traffic to all control plane nodes' API servers (port 6443):
   Example `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`:
   ```
   frontend k8s-api
       bind *:6443
       default_backend k8s-masters

   backend k8s-masters
       balance roundrobin
       server cp1 192.168.1.9:6443 check
       server cp2 192.168.1.3:6443 check
       server cp3 192.168.1.8:6443 check
   ```


**short Keepalived config example** for your 3 control-plane nodes:

---

### `/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf`

**On control-plane-1 (192.168.1.9, MASTER):**

```conf
vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state MASTER
    interface <your_network_interface>
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 101
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass 42
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.1.100
    }
}
```

**On control-plane-2 (192.168.1.3, BACKUP):**

```conf
vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state BACKUP
    interface <your_network_interface>
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 100
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass 42
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.1.100
    }
}
```

**On control-plane-3 (192.168.1.8, BACKUP):**

```conf
vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state BACKUP
    interface <your_network_interface>
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 99
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass 42
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.1.100
    }
}
```

---

âœ… Replace `<your_network_interface>` with your NIC (e.g., `eth0`, `ens33`).
âœ… Restart Keepalived on all nodes, the VIP `192.168.1.100` should float between them.

---

ðŸ‘‰ Do you also want me to compress your **HAProxy + Keepalived setup** into one short, ready-to-use config snippet for `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` and `/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf` together?


4. **Restart services**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart haproxy keepalived
   ```

5. **Set `controlPlaneEndpoint` in your kubeadm config to the VIP:**
   ```yaml
   controlPlaneEndpoint: "192.168.1.100:6443"
   ```
